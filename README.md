# Photo Colorization Model
Welcome to the Photo Colorization Model repository! This project aims to provide a powerful machine-learning solution for transforming black-and-white photos into vibrant, realistic color images. The model uses advanced deep learning techniques and comprises an encoder, decoder, fusion layer, and classification layer.

# Model Architecture

Our colorization model consists of the following components:
> Encoder: Extracts essential features from black and white images.
> Decoder: Generates high-resolution color images based on the encoded features.
> Fusion Layer: Combines encoded features with external references, enhancing colorization accuracy.
> Classification Layer: Understands and classifies different objects and scenes within the image, guiding the colorization process.
