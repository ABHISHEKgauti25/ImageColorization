#Photo Colorization Model
Welcome to the Photo Colorization Model repository! This project aims to provide a powerful machine learning solution for transforming black and white photos into vibrant and realistic color images. The model is built using advanced deep learning techniques and comprises an encoder, decoder, fusion layer, and classification layer.

# Model Architecture
Our colorization model consists of the following components:

Encoder: Extracts essential features from black and white images.
Decoder: Generates high-resolution color images based on the encoded features.
Fusion Layer: Combines encoded features with external references, enhancing colorization accuracy.
Classification Layer: Understands and classifies different objects and scenes within the image, guiding the colorization process.
